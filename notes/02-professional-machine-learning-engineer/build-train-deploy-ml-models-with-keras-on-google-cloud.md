## üóíÔ∏è Summary
This module introduces the TensorFlow ecosystem, covering its core components, layered API hierarchy, and integration with tools like Keras for efficient model building. It explains the structure of TensorFlow‚Äîfrom low-level operations to high-level model training APIs‚Äîand emphasises the importance of designing scalable input data pipelines using the tf.data API. Users learn how to work with both in-memory and file-based datasets, apply preprocessing steps, and prepare data effectively for machine learning models, including the use of embeddings for representing categorical variables.

The hands-on sessions focus on building practical pipelines and models using TensorFlow. Learners apply the tf.data API for efficient data handling and combine it with Keras preprocessing layers for seamless integration of preprocessing into the model itself. The final lab guides users through building and training a classifier on structured data, demonstrating how to scale preprocessing and training in an end-to-end workflow‚Äîensuring consistency between training and inference environments.

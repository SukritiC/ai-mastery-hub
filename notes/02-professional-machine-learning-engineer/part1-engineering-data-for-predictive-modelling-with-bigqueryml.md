## 🗒️ Summary
This module provides a practical walkthrough of building and executing data transformation pipelines using Cloud Dataprep and Google Cloud Dataflow with BigQuery (Python). It begins with setting up a BigQuery dataset and integrating it with Dataprep for interactive data exploration, cleaning, and enrichment using a visual interface. Users then run transformation jobs that output to BigQuery. The second part focuses on enabling the Dataflow API and working with a code-driven ETL process, covering ingestion, transformation, enrichment, and creating a full pipeline from data lake to data mart, leveraging Cloud Storage and Dataflow for scalable data operations.

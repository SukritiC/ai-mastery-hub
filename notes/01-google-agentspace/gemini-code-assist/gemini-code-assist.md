## 🗒️ Summary
<p>Gemini Code Assist is an AI-powered coding assistant developed by Google, embedded into IDEs like VS Code, JetBrains, Cloud Workstations, and Cloud Shell Editor. It uses large language models trained on billions of lines of open-source code and Google Cloud documentation to provide intelligent code completions, generate code blocks from comments, create unit tests, and assist with debugging and code understanding. It supports over 30 programming languages and offers contextual responses with source citations and license details for quoted material.</p>
<p>To use Gemini Code Assist, users must first configure their Google Cloud environment by setting project details, enabling the Cloud AI Companion API, and assigning necessary IAM roles. Then, they create and launch a Cloud Workstation, ensuring it’s ready before proceeding. Finally, the Cloud Code extension in the IDE connects to Google Cloud through a sign-in flow, completing the setup. With the environment ready, developers can improve their app by fixing code quality, enhancing readability, particularly for non-native English speakers, and refining the visual design of the application.</p>

ADK (Agent Development Kit) helps build structured multi-agent systems using a tree-based architecture, with LLM agents for intelligent tasks and workflow agents (Sequential, Loop, Parallel, Custom) for deterministic flows. It supports callbacks for customization and control, local testing, and scalable deployment via Agent Engine on Vertex AI. ADK also includes evaluation tools for response accuracy and tool usage, ensuring reliable, production-ready agents.

## 🗒️ Summary
### Part 1
The Agent Development Kit (ADK) by Google Cloud is a Python-based SDK designed to help developers build, manage, and deploy powerful AI agents and multi-agent systems with ease, even without deep AI expertise. It supports flexible development approaches—from conversational agents and internal knowledge tools to fully custom systems using LangChain or the Gen AI SDK. ADK enables real-time, LLM-powered interactions with built-in memory, artifact storage, orchestration, evaluation tools, and seamless deployment via Agent Engine. It also integrates with external APIs, supports code execution, and promotes modular, collaborative development using tools and models like Gemini or other LLMs.

## 🗒️ Summary
This lab provides a comprehensive hands-on tutorial on building, testing, and deploying a generative AI agent using Google’s Vertex AI Agent Engine and the Gemini model. It guides you through setting up the environment, defining a Gemini-based agent capable of performing real-time currency exchange lookups via a Python function, and integrating it using LangChain for reasoning. The agent is tested locally for functionality and then deployed to Vertex AI, enabling cloud-based inference via SDK or REST API. The lab emphasizes modularity, allowing users to customize each component—model configurations, tools, and orchestration—making it an ideal starting point for building scalable, production-grade AI agents.

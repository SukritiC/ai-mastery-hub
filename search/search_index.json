It then transitions to the core topic of model evaluation, establishing it as a fundamental component of the MLOps lifecycle. The notes introduce the common challenges associated with model evaluation and present Google\u2019s Vertex AI as a platform offering robust solutions to overcome these hurdles. The main focus of the notes is a deep dive into model evaluation specifically for Generative AI. This section addresses the unique challenges posed by Large Language Models (LLMs) and frames their evaluation as both an art and a science. It emphasizes the need to move beyond simple accuracy metrics to a more holistic set of evaluation criteria. The notes outline best practices for LLM evaluation and detail two key methodologies:</p> <ol> <li>Computation-based Metrics: Streamlining evaluation through objective, automated calculations. </li> <li>Model-based Evaluation: Comparing the performance of a candidate model against a benchmark or reference model.</li> </ol> <p>Overall, the notes serve as a guide to navigating the complexities of modern model evaluation, from foundational principles to the advanced techniques required to effectively assess today\u2019s sophisticated generative models.</p>"},{"location":"notes/04-deploy-and-manage-gen-ai-models/ml-ops-for-gen-ai/#table-of-contents","title":"\ud83d\udcda Table of Contents","text":"<ol> <li>The Evolution of MLOps </li> <li>MLOps</li> <li>Predictive AI</li> <li>Generative AI</li> <li>Introduction of Model Evaluation</li> <li>Model Evaluation with MLOps</li> <li>Model Evaluation Challenges and Solutions offered by Vertex AI</li> <li>Model Evaluation for Generative AI</li> <li>Challenges of evaluating the Gen AI Tasks</li> <li>The Art and Science of Evaluating LLMs</li> <li>Beyond Accuracy: Mastering Evaluation Metrics for Gen AI</li> <li>Best Practices for LLM Evaluation</li> <li>Solving Evaluation Challenges</li> <li>Streamlining Model evaluation with computation based Metrics</li> <li>Comparing performances with Model based evaluation</li> </ol>"},{"location":"notes/Projects-mvp/01-AI-land-image-analyzer/","title":"\ud83c\udf3f Land Image Analyser","text":"<p>AI-powered land and crop insights \u2014 just upload a photo and get instant analysis.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"notes/Projects-mvp/01-AI-land-image-analyzer/#overview","title":"\ud83d\udcd6 Overview","text":"<p>Explore the complete journey of the Land Image Analyser \u2014 from idea to working MVP \u2014 through a detailed video demo and an in-depth technical blog.</p>"},{"location":"notes/Projects-mvp/01-AI-land-image-analyzer/#mvp-video-demo","title":"MVP Video Demo","text":"<p>Experience the end-to-end walkthrough of the project \u2014 covering the architecture, Google Cloud setup, and real-time AI insights in action.
